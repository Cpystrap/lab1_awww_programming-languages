# About Programming Languages and Their Popularity in the Modern World

***

Nowadays, as the world struggles with processing an increasing amount of data, program speed is becoming more important. As computer hardware fails to keep up with these demands, the speed of programming languages becomes crucial. It is no surprise that languages like C++, Go, Rust, and their fast cousins – Mojo and Zig – are gaining popularity in the TIOBE Index.

Although Python is considered a slow language, it remains one of the most popular. Why? Because ease of learning is also an important factor that attracts programmers. Instead of focusing solely on performance, today's world values how quickly one can master a programming language. As a result, Python, with its simplicity, has become one of the most commonly chosen languages by new programmers, and the demand for them is not decreasing. After all, the world needs more programmers, and Python is perfect for those starting their programming journey.

**The TIOBE Index** is one of the main indicators of programming language popularity. It provides a ranking of languages updated monthly based on the number of qualified engineers, courses, and materials available online. Popular websites like Google, Amazon, Wikipedia, and Bing are used for calculations.

Although the TIOBE Index does not measure the "best" programming language but rather its popularity, it gives an excellent overview of the market and shows which languages are most sought after by programmers worldwide.

On this page, you will find detailed data on programming languages, their popularity, and how many times they have topped the TIOBE Hall of Fame.
